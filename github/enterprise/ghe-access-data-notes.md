#### After ghe 3.0+

Why Canâ€™t You Find the Backend Database in GitHub Enterprise 3.0+?

Starting from GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) 3.0+, including version 3.15, GitHub Enterprise no longer exposes a traditional PostgreSQL or MySQL backend database to administrators. Instead, GitHub has moved to a highly integrated internal architecture that restricts direct database access. Hereâ€™s why:

1. GitHub Enterprise 3.x Uses a New Internal Storage System
   â€¢	Earlier versions (before GitHub Enterprise 3.0) stored repository, user, and activity data in PostgreSQL or MySQL databases, which administrators could access.
   â€¢	Newer versions (3.0 and later) store data in internal services using a mix of Raft-based distributed storage, internal SQLite instances, and custom APIs.
   â€¢	These internal components are not accessible via standard database clients like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
2. Restricted Access to Databases
   â€¢	The PostgreSQL or MySQL databases that were accessible in older versions are now fully abstracted and hidden.
   â€¢	GitHub Enterprise stores its state using internal metadata storage, but direct querying is not supported anymore.
   â€¢	Instead of direct database queries, GitHub encourages using GraphQL and REST APIs.
3. Alternative Ways to Access Data in GitHub Enterprise 3.15

Since direct database connections are not possible, you should use the following methods:

Option 1: Use GitHub Enterprise GraphQL API
	â€¢	GraphQL API provides structured access to repository metadata, issues, pull requests, commits, and other data.
	â€¢	Example query to fetch repositories:

{
  organization(login: "my-org") {
    repositories(first: 10) {
      nodes {
        name
        createdAt
        updatedAt
      }
    }
  }
}

    â€¢	API Endpoint:

https://`<your-github-enterprise-domain>`/api/graphql

Option 2: Use GitHub REST API
	â€¢	The REST API allows fetching repository data, audit logs, and user activity.
	â€¢	Example request to get repository details:

curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR-TOKEN" 
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json"
    "https://`<your-github-enterprise-domain>`/api/v3/orgs/my-org/repos"

    â€¢	API Documentation: GitHub Enterprise REST API

Option 3: Export Audit Logs for Analysis

If you need to monitor activities such as user logins, repository modifications, or security incidents:
	â€¢	Enable audit log streaming to an external SIEM or database.
	â€¢	Use:

ghe-export-audit-logs > audit-logs.json

Option 4: Sync GitHub Data to an External Database

If your goal is to connect Power BI or other BI tools, you can periodically extract data from GitHub Enterprise APIs and store it in an external SQL database.

Steps
	1.	Set up a scheduled job (e.g., Power Automate, Python script, or a scheduled cron job) to pull data from the API.
	2.	Store the data in an external PostgreSQL or SQL Server database.
	3.	Connect Power BI to that database.

Conclusion

In GitHub Enterprise 3.15, you cannot directly access a backend PostgreSQL or MySQL database because it is now part of GitHubâ€™s internal architecture. Instead, you should use GraphQL API, REST API, audit logs, or data extraction to an external database for analysis.
