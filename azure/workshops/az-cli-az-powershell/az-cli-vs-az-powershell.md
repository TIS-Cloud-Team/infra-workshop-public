Both Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell are command-line tools for managing Azure resources, but they have different use cases and syntax. Here's a comparison:

### Azure CLI

- **Syntax**: Command-line interface with commands starting with `az`.
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Use Case**: Preferred for scripting and automation in environments where cross-platform support is needed.
- **Installation**: Install via package managers like `brew` on macOS, `apt-get` on Linux, or MSI on Windows.

### Azure PowerShell

- **Syntax**: PowerShell cmdlets with commands starting with `Az`.
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) but traditionally used more on Windows.
- **Use Case**: Preferred for users familiar with PowerShell scripting and for integrating with other PowerShell scripts.
- **Installation**: Install via PowerShell Gallery using `Install-Module -Name Az`.

### Example Commands

#### Azure CLI

```sh
az cloud set --name AzureUSGovernment
az cloud set --name AzureCloud

# List all resource groups
az group list

# Create a new resource group
az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location eastus
```

#### Azure PowerShell

```powershell
# List all resource groups
Get-AzResourceGroup

# Create a new resource group
New-AzResourceGroup -Name MyResourceGroup -Location eastus
```

### Summary

- **Azure CLI**: Best for cross-platform scripting and automation.
- **Azure PowerShell**: Best for users familiar with PowerShell and integrating with other PowerShell scripts.
