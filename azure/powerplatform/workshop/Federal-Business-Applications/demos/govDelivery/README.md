## Installing the Custom Connector
To get started, you will need a govDelivery account and an API key to connect to their APIs.  Details on govDelivery's APIs can be found below,

[govDelivery API Docs](https://developer.govdelivery.com/api/tms/overview/Setup/)

To install the sample custom connector, download the following swagger OpenAPI connection file,

[govDelivery Swagger Definition File](files/govDelivery.swagger.json)

Next, go to Power Automate > Data > Custom Connectors.

Next, create a new custom connector from an OpenAPI file,

Import the ```govDelivery.swagger.json``` you downloaded previously.  Name the connector ```govDelivery```
