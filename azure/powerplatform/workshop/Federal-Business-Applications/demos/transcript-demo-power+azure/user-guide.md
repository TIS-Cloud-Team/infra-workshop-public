### Upload Audio File
To get started, upload click the attachment control

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acc8c6eb-48b8-46ce-8992-77817582fd2a)

Please select MP3 or WAV file.  Note: this demo oly supports these two formats, but [Azure Batch Speech to Text supports the following formats](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/batch-transcription-audio-data?tabs=portal#supported-audio-formats-and-codecs):
- WAV
- MP3
- OPUS/OGG
- FLAC
- WMA
- AAC
- ALAW in WAV container
- MULAW in WAV container
- AMR
- WebM
- M4A
- SPEEX

Next, enter how many speakers are in the recording.  Azure Speech to Text services can diarize up to 36 speakers, but you need to tell hit how many to expect for the service to work well.  

Once selected, click **Upload**.  The audio file is then uploaded as an attachment to a new item in your SharePoint list.  *Note: this is only required due to current [limitations](#limitations) with Azure Blob Storage connector in Power Apps.*

Behind the scenes, Power Automate executes a series of flows to generate the transcript (via Azure Batch Speech to Text services) and then load the transcript into Dataverse. This can take 30-60 minutes depending on the length of the audio file.

### View Transcript
