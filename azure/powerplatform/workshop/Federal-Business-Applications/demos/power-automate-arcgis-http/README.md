# Populating Dataverse with ArcGIS Feature Service Data

## Overview

This document will describe one method of using Microsoft Power Automate to query the ArcGIS Feature Service REST API and load the resulting data into a Dataverse table.  It assumes the reader is comfortable with querying the ArcGIS REST API and with creating Flows in Power Automate.  Further information on the ArcGIS REST API can be found in the [ArcGIS REST API Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/).  Further information on Power Automate can be found in the [Power Automate Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/).

The document describes the process in three parts.
#### Obtain an OAUTH 2.0 authentication token from the ArcGIS web service.  
An OAUTH 2.0 token is required to access secured ArcGIS resources.  As of this writing, the default lifespan of the ArcGIS OAUTH 2.0 tokens is two hours with a configurable maximum lifespan of two weeks.  In order to make sure our flow has a valid token, we will configure the flow to obtain a new token automatically each time it runs.  The API calls for this part of the process are outlined in the [ArcGIS OAUTH documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/oauth-2.0/).

#### Connect to the Feature Service and query Feature attributes.  
We will connect to the ArcGIS Feature Service sample endpoint and return an array of Trails.  For each Trail, we will return the following attributes:  ```TRL_NAME```, ```TRL_ID```, ```LENGTH_FT```, ```USE_BIKE```, and ```USE_HIKE```, and load them into a Dataverse Table.  The API calls for this part of the process are outlined in the [ArcGIS Feature Service API Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/query-feature-service-.htm).

#### Load Epoch data Types from ArcGIS into the Common Data Service.
The ArcGIS Feature Service can return dates in Epoch format (number of milliseconds since 1/1/1970).  [Epoch format details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).  These data types may need to be converted before being loaded into a Dataverse Table.  This document will discuss strategies for loading Epoch data types.

## Prerequisites

### ArcGIS Developer Account
To complete the first section, you will need an ArcGIS Developer account.  If you do not have one, you can create an ArcGIS Developer account at the [ArcGIS Developer Sign up Page](https://developers.arcgis.com/sign-up/)

### ArcGIS Application
To complete the second section, you will need to have a registered Application in ArcGIS.  If you do not have an Application you can create one by following steps 1-4 in the [ArcGIS Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/tutorials/register-your-application/)

### Create a Table to Store Data
We will query the service for information about trails.  To store this information, create an Table called ```ArcGIS``` in Dataverse with the custom fields below.  Note that the **Primary Name** field should be ```TRL_NAME```:

| Field Name | Data Type |
| --------- | :---: |
| ```TRL_NAME``` | Text |
| ```LENGTH_FT``` | Whole Number |
| ```TRL_ID``` | Whole Number |
| ```USE_BIKE``` | Text |
| ```USE_HIKE``` | Text |

## Step by Step Example  

1.	To obtain an OAUTH 2.0 token, you will need the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your Application.  These can be found in the OAUTH 2.0 area of your Dashboard as shown in the screenshot below. 

![ArcGIS Application](files/2.png)

2.	In the Power Apps Maker portal, create a new **Instant cloud flow**. 

![Instant Cloud Flow](files/3.png)

3.	Name the Flow **ArcGIS Sample** and set the trigger to **Manually trigger a flow**. 

![Cloud Flow Settings](files/4.png)

4.	Add an **HTTP** action and configure it as shown below, using your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Step 1.  We will set the ```expiration``` parameter to ```21600```.  This will return a token with a six-hour lifespan. 

| Field Name | Value |
| --------- | :---: |
| Method | ```POST``` |
| ```URL``` | ```https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/oauth2/token/``` |
| ```client_id``` | YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE |
| ```client_secret``` | YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE |
| ```grant_type``` | ```client_credentials``` |
| ```expiration``` | ```21600``` |

![HTTP Details](files/5.png)

5.	Save and Test the flow.  Inspect the **OUTPUTS** area of the **HTTP** action and ensure the ```Status code``` is ```200``` and the **Body** contains an ```access_token``` as shown below.

6.	Add another **HTTP** Action to the flow and configure it with the parameters shown below.    We will set the **where** parameter to filter the rows and return a subset of the data.  To pass the token we received in the previous step, we set the ```token``` parameter to the following expression: ```body('HTTP')?[ 'access_token']```. Note that the token is not required to run the sample query but will be required to access secured resources. 

| Field Name | Value |
| --------- | :---: |
| Method | ```POST``` |
| URL | ```https://services3.arcgis.com/GVgbJbqm8hXASVYi/arcgis/rest/services/Trails/FeatureServer/0/query``` |
| ```content_type``` | ```application/x-www-form-urlencoded``` |
| ```f``` | ```json``` |
| ```where``` | ```TRL_NAME like 'a%'``` |
| ```outSr``` | ```4326``` |
| ```outFields``` | ```*``` |
| ```token``` | Expression: ```body('HTTP')?[ 'access_token']``` |

7.	Save and Test the flow.  Inspect the **OUTPUTS** area of the **HTTP_2** action and ensure the ```Status code``` is ```200``` and the **Body** contains the JSON object data as shown below. 

![HTTP 2 Output](files/8.png)

8.	Add an **Apply to each** action as shown below.  To iterate over each Feature returned by the query, we set the **Select an output from previous steps** field to the following expression: ```body('HTTP_2')?['features']```. 

![Apply to Each](files/9.png)

9.	Add a **Dataverse – Add a new row** action to the **Apply to each** step as shown below.  Use the following expression syntax for each of the fields.

| Field Name | Expression |
| --------- | :---: |
| ```TRL_NAME``` | ```items('Apply_to_each')?['attributes']?['TRL_NAME']```  |
| ```TRL_ID``` | ```items('Apply_to_each')?['attributes']?['TRL_ID']```  |
| ```TRL_LENGTH``` | ```items('Apply_to_each')?['attributes']?['LENGTH_FT']```  |
| ```USE_BIKE``` | ```items('Apply_to_each')?['attributes']?['USE_BIKE']```  |
| ```USE_HIKE``` | ```items('Apply_to_each')?['attributes']?['USE_HIKE']```  |

![Add a new row](files/10.png)

10.	Save and Test the flow.  Inspect the **OUTPUTS** area of the first **Create a new record** action and ensure the attributes are being loaded with data as shown below. 

![Dataverse Outputs](files/11.png)

11.	To view the new data, select the **All Columns** view in the Table designer.  To load the entire dataset, delete the current records, change the ```where``` parameter to ```1=1``` (Step 6), and run the flow again.

## Epoch Data Types

ArcGIS stores some date/time date fields as Unix epoch data types.  These are expressed as an integer representing the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.  For example, the value **1546096196000** would equate to **2018-12-29 03:09:56 PM**.  To load these fields into Dataverse as date/time data types, we must convert them using the following method.

a.	Make sure the value isn’t null.

b.	Divide the epoch date by 1000 to get number of seconds since 1/1/1970.

c.	Use the ```addseconds``` function to add the result to 1/1/1970.


As an example, if we are using the flow from this document to return an epoch date/time field called '''GIS_DATE''', we can use the following formula to convert the data type.

```
if(equals(items('Apply_to_each')?['attributes']?[‘GIS_DATE’],null),null,addseconds('1970-1-1', Div(items('Apply_to_each')?['attributes']?[‘GIS_DATE’],1000) , 'yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss tt'))
```
