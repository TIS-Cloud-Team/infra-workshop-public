## üö® Important Guidelines

To maintain the security and integrity of both your personal information and our organization‚Äôs data, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing:

1. **Avoid Committing Sensitive Information**

   - **Do Not** include any credentials, API keys, passwords, or secret tokens in your code or configuration files.
   - **Do Not** check in any proprietary or confidential organizational data.
2. **Use Environment Variables**

   - Store sensitive information in environment variables or secure vaults.
   - Refer to [Best Practices for Managing Secrets](https://example.com/best-practices) for more information.
3. **Review Before Committing**

   - Double-check your commits to ensure no sensitive data is being pushed.
   - Use tools like [GitGuardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/) to scan for accidental exposures.
4. **Personal Information**

   - Refrain from including personal identifiable information (PII) in any files within the repository.

### Additional Recommendations:

1. **Add a `.gitignore` File**: Ensure that files containing sensitive information (like `.env` files) are excluded from the repository by adding them to your `.gitignore`.

   ```gitignore
   # Environment Variables
   .env
   ```
2. **Use Git Hooks**: Implement pre-commit hooks to automatically prevent committing sensitive files. Tools like [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) can help set this up.
3. **Provide Templates**: Offer template files (e.g., `.env.example`) that contributors can copy and configure locally without exposing actual secrets.
4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review the repository for accidental exposures using automated tools.

By incorporating these guidelines and practices, you help ensure that your repository remains secure and focused on its educational objectives.
